# Learning Ktor and Netty

I started studying Ktor as an introduction to learning server-side code, due to my familiarity with Kotlin. In order to not pigeonhole myself in the world of Kotlin though, I have since [switched to Node.js](https://github.com/DavidPrecopia/NodeJS_REST_API_Practice) as my backend language of choice.

Stared off with adding Ktor's dependencies as described in [Adding Ktor to an existing Gradle project](https://ktor.io/docs/gradle.html), highlighted in the [init branch](https://github.com/DavidPrecopia/KtorLearning/tree/init).

From there, I implemented a full API for checking and placing orders via [Creating HTTP APIs](https://ktor.io/docs/creating-http-apis.html), highlighted in the [tutorial branch](https://github.com/DavidPrecopia/KtorLearning/tree/tutorial).

My quick and dirty scratch notes from my studies can be found [here](https://david-m-precopia.medium.com/learning-ktor-quick-and-dirty-scratch-notes-377fa60089ba).
